# Portfolio-GraphicEngine
The engine is capable of loading 3D models and displaying them using PBR, improving visual quality through post-processing such as Blur and SSAO, as well as reading .hdr images that are used to create skyboxes and generate IBLs to provide ambient light to the models.
It is necessary to have a graphics card that supports OpenGL 4.5 or higher, and Windows x64

## Libraries
- Assimp: Load 3d models
- OpenGL Mathematics: It has useful functions to operate with matrices and vectors
- GLFW: Create a window and have listeners for keyboard and mouse input
- STB: Read image files

## Current status
Under development. In a future I'll be adding more features such as clear coat or emissive materials, and post-processing effects such as blur or chromatic aberration. Apart from the visual aspect, I'll also apply improvements in the loading speed of the models and various performance improvements.
